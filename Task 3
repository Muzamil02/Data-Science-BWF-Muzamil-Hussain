Probability is a measure between 0 and 1 that expresses the likelihood of an event, such as the probability of rolling an even number on a die being 0.5. 
Probability distribution for discrete random variables assigns probabilities to each event in a sample space, summing to 1. The average indicates central tendency. 
Average has several types i.e.
•	Arithmetic Mean: Sum of values divided by their count, e.g., 4, 3, 1, 6, 1, 7 the mean is (4+3+1+6+1+7)/6= 22/6 = 3.6.
•	Median: Middle value in an ordered set, e.g., 1, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 the median is 3.5.
•	Mode: Most common value in number set e.g., 4,3,1,6,1,7 the mode is 1.
